fix: improve explore-chains command behavior and progress bar

This commit fixes several issues with the explore-chains command:

1. Fixed the command execution to properly recognize explore-chains as a command
   rather than treating it as a chain selection attempt when used after the
   start command.

2. Improved progress bar behavior for the explore-chains command:
   - When used outside the guided flow, the progress bar now correctly resets
     to step 0 instead of showing all steps as completed
   - When used as part of the guided flow (after broadcast-tx), it properly
     advances to step 5

3. Enhanced the explore-chains command output to show appropriate messages
   based on the user's progress in the guided flow:
   - Shows congratulations only after completing the full guided flow
   - Shows a simpler message for subsequent completions
   - Shows a generic message when used outside the guided flow

These changes ensure that the explore-chains command works correctly at any
point in the flow while maintaining the integrity of the guided tutorial
experience.

feat: add tutorial completion status and reset button

This commit adds visual indication when the tutorial has been completed and provides a way to reset the tutorial progress:

1. Added a "Completed" badge to the progress indicators when the tutorial is completed
2. Added a reset button to allow users to restart the tutorial
3. Applied a subtle greyed-out effect to the progress indicators when the tutorial is completed
4. Added a "Tutorial Completed" badge to the terminal header
5. Improved the tutorial completion tracking with dedicated helper functions

These changes enhance the user experience by providing clear visual feedback about the tutorial status and allowing users to easily restart the tutorial if needed.

fix: correct tutorial progress steps to match actual flow

This commit fixes the tutorial progress steps to match the actual flow of the tutorial:

1. Removed the "Get help" step from the beginning of the progress bar
2. Added a proper "Select chain" step to represent the chain selection phase
3. Updated the guidedFlow array to correctly reference the steps

These changes ensure that the progress bar accurately reflects the actual tutorial flow, making it more intuitive for users to follow along with the guided experience.
